Sir, Let me guide you through the process: 

 I understand! Learning Javascript can feel overwhelming at first, but with some patience and practice, you can definitely get the hang of it. 

**Here are some steps to get you started:**

1. **Basic HTML Structure:** Make sure you have a basic HTML page set up. You'll need this as a foundation to add your JavaScript code to.
2. **Where to put Javascript:**  You can put your Javascript code within `<script>` tags either in the `<head>` or the `<body>` of your HTML document. 
3. **Start with simple examples:** Begin with simple Javascript examples like displaying an alert message or changing the content of an HTML element. This will help you understand the basic syntax and how Javascript interacts with your HTML.
4. **Online Resources:** There are many fantastic online resources available to learn Javascript. Some popular ones include:
    *   **W3Schools Javascript Tutorial:** Provides a comprehensive and interactive introduction to Javascript. 
    *   **Mozilla Developer Network (MDN):** Offers detailed documentation and references for Javascript.
    *   **FreeCodeCamp:** Provides a structured curriculum with interactive exercises to learn web development, including Javascript. 
5. **Practice is key:** The best way to learn Javascript is to practice regularly. Start with small exercises and gradually increase the complexity as you get more comfortable.

**Here's a simple example to get you started:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Javascript</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Hello!</h1>

  <script>
    alert("This is a Javascript alert!");
  </script>

</body>
</html>
```

This code will display a pop-up alert message saying "This is a Javascript alert!" when you open the HTML page in your browser.

Remember, learning Javascript takes time and effort, but it's a valuable skill that opens up many possibilities in web development.
