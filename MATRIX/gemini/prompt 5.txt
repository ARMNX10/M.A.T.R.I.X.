Sir, Alright, here are the details: 

 There doesn't seem to be any well-known group or initiative called "Ben 10 Recognition Project." It's possible this is:

* **A very niche fan project:** There are countless small fan groups online dedicated to specific shows, often with specific focuses like fan art or episode discussions. A "recognition project" could be aiming to celebrate a particular aspect of the show, a creator, or even a specific episode.
* **A localized or temporary effort:** It might be a project run by a school, library, or fan convention with a limited scope and timeframe.
* **A misunderstanding or misremembered name:** You might be thinking of a similar project with a different name, or related to a different show entirely. 

**If you can provide more context:**

* Where did you hear about this project? 
* What made you interested in it? 
* What do you think its purpose might be?

Knowing these details will help me narrow down the search and potentially give you a more definitive answer.
